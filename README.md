### As-Salaamu `alaykum wa rahmatullah

In the name of Allah / Bismillah,
And all praise to Allah / Walhamdulillah,
And salah and salaam to the Messenger of Allah / Wassalaatu wassalaamu 'alaa rasuulillah

Often times, there are voices asking to unite--some are even under some kind of facade for wordly interests

This is coming from an IT guy, there are no benefits for me whatsoever.

I've looked at github's muslim-tagged repo is often just quran again, azan again, adkar again.

But point taken, there are a number of us here.

This is a proof of concept, could we--github lurker-- really unite?

It won't charge you. Just star the repo so we could know how many of us are here.

This isn't even my main github, those stars aren't going anywhere really.

Perhaps, we can then create an issue here to discuss ummah stuff, github-style.

With salams,
the repo's creator, web maintainer, also dns maintainer.

Multiple sources for High-availability. Something might happen to this.
